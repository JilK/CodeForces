'''
Santa has n candies and he wants to gift them to k kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all k kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.

Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has a candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has b candies. Then Santa will be satisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:

b−a≤1 (it means b=a or b=a+1);
the number of kids who has a+1 candies (note that a+1 not necessarily equals b) does not exceed ⌊k2⌋ (less than or equal to ⌊k2⌋).
⌊k2⌋ is k divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if k=5 then ⌊k2⌋=⌊52⌋=2.

Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤5⋅104) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. The i-th test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤109) — the number of candies and the number of kids.

Output
For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.
